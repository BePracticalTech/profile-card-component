## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Be Practical](https://bepractical.tech/FrontendChallenges) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this `profile-card-Component` and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find a desktop version of the design. 

The design is in PNG static format. Using PNGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `./style_guide.md` file such as color palette , fonts and image links . The assets are already optimized.
